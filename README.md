# Start
  overall it's a Single Page App with a config.js file as the data source. By putting in 
  your personal info into that config file that data will propogate itself throughout the app.
  Each UI element is standalone with its own css/js/jsx *(you can plug in and out)*

# Feedback 
  I'm actively working on making this app better if there are any bugs, requests, or cool improvements 
  feel free to make an issue request; please and thank you.
