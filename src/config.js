                I am most amazed by his ability to absorb information and produce a work of art, anything he envisions 
                he brings into fruition. Working with Jonathan has changed our development team, his passion became our 
                fuel as we dove into uncharted waters, we've managed to reach depths we never thought possible. This has 
                brought about change not only within our product but also within ourselves. In turn Jonathon has become 
                an invaluable member of our team, Pand if fate allows it I would like nothing more than to work with him in the future.`,

                and assignments we had worked on together. He was flexible, easy to work 
                with and a great team player on the projects we were assigned together. He is a passionate individual 
                who is very willing and motivated to learn and grow as a developer and individual.
                Overall Jonathan would be an excellent addition to a software engineering role.
